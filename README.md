# Car-Price-Predictor
üöÄ I'm thrilled to share a project I worked on  I had the incredible opportunity to work on a Car Price Prediction using cutting-edge AI/ML neural networks.Developing this system was a transformative experience, offering valuable insights for both sellers and buyers in the automotive market.

üîç Project Overview:
In this project, I utilized a linear regression model to predict the resale values of cars. By leveraging a dataset that includes features such as car make, model, year, mileage, and fuel type, I applied one-hot encoding and column transformers to preprocess the data effectively. This approach ensured that categorical variables were appropriately handled, and the model could learn from all relevant information.

The result is a robust system that provides accurate car price predictions, offering significant value to both sellers and buyers in the automotive market. This project has been a fantastic learning experience, enhancing my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and predictive analytics.
